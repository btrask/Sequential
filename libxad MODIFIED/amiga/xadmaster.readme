The XAD system is for file extraction from archives! It can be compared
to XFD system, which is for single file decrunching. They do different
work, but are used together often.

This is a library providing an interface for unarchiving all possible
types of file or disk archives. It is NOT an archiver GUI or anything
like that. This system does the COMPLETE unarchiving stuff with internal
routines, NOT calling shell programs or using other programs to do the
work!

The interface can be built by application programs like included shell
utilities. It provides same features and interface for ALL types of
supported archivers. E.g. virus checkers could use this system to do
very comfortable background archive checking.

This software is under LGPL. See conditions in documentation file.
